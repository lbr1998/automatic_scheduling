# automatic_scheduling
Currently, most companion service systems rely on manual resource assignment, leading to highly inefficient scheduling and difficulty in maximizing resource utilization. To more efficiently connect companions and clients and allocate resources reasonably, we aim to ensure that each companion's working hours are fully utilized and that orders are distributed fairly among companions. Therefore, we plan to design a companion assignment system that achieves accurate travel time predictions, rational resource assignment, and efficient matching, finally improving system efficiency and user satisfaction.

Hardware Components:
1.	Computer or Server:
	A machine capable of running Python and other necessary software libraries.
	Recommended: At least 8GB of RAM and a modern multi-core CPU.

Software Components:
1.	Python 3.8+:
    Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your machine.
3.	Google Maps API:
    Used for calculating travel details between locations.
  	Requires a Google Cloud account and an API key.
5.	Matplotlib:
    For visualizing the task schedules.
7.	Other Python Libraries:
    datetime, typing, googlemaps, matplotlib, etc.
